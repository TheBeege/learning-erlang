# Learning Erlang

Once upon a time, Beege was on a plane. He paid for wifi for work, so he wanted to make use of it. Minecraft was too difficult to play without a mouse and a poor connection. Online turn-based games make Beege sleepy. So he decided to start a new tradition: Plane rides are time to learn new languages.

This repository is following the tutorial found in the [Getting Started with Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/seq_prog) guide.

## Aside

The tradition may not last. I'm a product management team lead, now. Is there value to learing new languages? On the other hand, this is my spare time, so I should do what I like. But I like being productive, for all its good and evil. Then would it not be more productive to learn about product ownership, business analysis, project management, and the like? But is there also not value in understanding what technologies are out there for use? But if going down the technology route, why Erlang? Why not something like Mojo or Rust, which is more along the AI track? ...But if neural networks are pipelines of layers of functions, then maybe a functional language could be an opportunity. Meh, I'm already started. Let's go.

...After some tutorials and some reading, I had more thoughts. I went down the rabbit hole of why functional languages aren't popular for machine learning. In the end, I needed to meet my nemesis again: linear algebra. I then returned to wondering if this was a good use of my time. I'm certainly not opposed to learning linear algebra - turning enemies into friends is great - but that's a significant time investment, likely beyond the duration of this flight. 

For now, I will take a break to study more product and project management things. I will come back to Erlang sometime. I still have plenty of uses for highly-efficient, message-based distributed systems.
